# The Big Five Personality Traits

The big five personality traits, also known as the five factor model, delineate personality across five dimensions:

1. Openness (to experience) - the tendency to appreciate art, emotion, adventure, and unusual ideas
2. Conscientiousness - the tendency to show self-discipline, act dutifully, and aim for achievement
3. Extraversion - characterizes an individual’s level of energy, positive emotions, assertiveness, sociability, and the need for stimulation in social settings
4. Agreeableness - the tendency to be compassionate and cooperative rather than suspicious and antagonistic towards others
5. Neuroticism - the tendency to experience unpleasant emotions easily, such as anger, anxiety, depression, or vulnerability

Each dimension is a spectrum, as opposed to less scientifically valid personality tests such as Myers-Briggs, which tries to classify personalities into a finite number of clusters. Big five is widely recognized as the most scientifically valid way to measure personality in psychology. Modern research has pointed to the predictive utility of the traits (in terms of academic and occupational success, relationship satisfaction, mental health, etc.), the biological correlation (big five traits seem to be inherited to some extent), and the consistency of traits over time in longitudinal studies. A good introduction to the topic (albeit in Swedish) is given by Petri Kajonius and Anna Dåderman in their book "Vem är du?: den moderna forskningen om Big Five". 

# Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus

It is sometimes said that men are from Mars, and women are from Venus. But does this hold up scientifically? I want to test that by seeing what the differences in personality between men and women are, and how well a statistical model can predict gender based on big five test results.
